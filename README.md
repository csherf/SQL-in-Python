# SQL-in-Python
A SQL like database made in python

All Databases are stored as a table and Tables are json files. 

I wanted to get more familiar with JSON files so thats why I decided to use them as my storage method. Along with the parsing of data will be easier to work with than a csv since I cant use any libraries like pandas or numpy.
